# Words-from-Strangers
This will be a website that will allow anonymous people to leave things they are currently feeling for strangers to stumble upon.

## **Intro**
Between 2010-2015 there was a fairly popular concept of posting anonymous one off messages to a website. Be it for venting, bragging, confessing, or encouragement to others. 

## **Design Concept**
For my design, I want the main view to be a selection of 5 to 10 random messages others have left. The user will have the ability to refresh the page for more random messages or add one of their own. If the content passes automated moderation, it will be added to the list, then the user will be barred for a day or so from posting. The message will be stored into a database that keeps the time, date, message, and optionally the general location of where it was sent from. The user would be able to choose to get messages that are completely random, from a chosen area, or chosen time frame.

### *Homepage*:
It will consist of the initial selection of random messages and buttons to refresh the page for different messages

### *Submission page*:
Allows users to fill out a form that lets them send an anonymous message. Allows for the optional choice of submitting a location as well. Once submitted either with a cookie or using an IP address, this page will be unable to send more messages until a predetermined time (24 hours most likely) is up. This is to prevent spam and an oversaturation of a small group of people posting.

### *About page*:
This will be a simple page about the concept and idea along with the guidelines.

## **Conclusion**
Overall this is a relatively simple concept but one I very much loved back in the day. Things like Postsecret and things like that very much showed a side of humanity that isn't often seen so I would like to very much try to make something similar to that.
